### 2. 🏠 Move Pointer to Select a House
- On the map or layout interface, the user **moves the mouse pointer** and **clicks on a house** to select it.
- Selected house data (e.g., roof size, type) is used for cost calculation.

### 3. ⚙️ Select Roofing Options
- After selecting the house, the user is presented with options such as:
  - ✅ Roof Type (e.g., Asphalt, Metal, Tile)
  - 📏 Roof Size (automatically fetched or manually entered)
  - 🧱 Material Quality (Standard, Premium)

### 4. 📧 Enter Email & Name
- User fills a form:
  - **Full Name** (e.g., `Ali Khan`)
  - **Email Address** (e.g., `ali@example.com`)

### 5. 💰 Calculate Cost
- The system calculates total roofing cost based on:
